# The API Project
Please note: the API code is the default library, Run '<installer of choice> install requests' to obtain it
you can also use the API JSONS provided by https://docs.warframestat.us/ without the requests API (no clue if it will break)

Originally planned to just pull data and push it into a CSV
The Scope has quickly started shifting to something more diverse and accepting of quick searching of 'important' data.
As for now I am working on getting the baseline version of the project working
and then I will slowly expand it into various different tools from there

Feel free to suggest additional features as I will probably run out rather quickly
